## Overview
- The project is built as a modular web platform consisting of a React (Vite + JavaScript) frontend and a C# (.NET) backend.
- The backend currently implements authorization, user management, and real-time chat, but it is not yet connected to the live frontend.
- Layers are designed for API-based communication (REST, WebSocket).
